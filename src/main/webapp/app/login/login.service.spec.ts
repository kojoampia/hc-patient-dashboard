/**
 * One thing, and it is the one that was missing: authenticating in either direction must not leave behind a
 * selection about whose medical record is on screen.
 *
 * <p>`ActingAsService.clear()` existed from the day delegation was built, documented as "cleared on sign-out", and
 * had no callers at all. The consequence is not an untidy storage key: a care angel's selection survived into the
 * next person's session at the same browser, and because `setAvailable` accepts a remembered id that is still valid
 * for the new signer-in, it was applied silently — no picker, and the portal opened somebody else's record.</p>
