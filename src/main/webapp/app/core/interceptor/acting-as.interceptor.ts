 * <h2>Why this is an interceptor and not a service method</h2>
 *
 * <p>Once a care angel can act for somebody else, "which patient is this request about" stops being implied by the
 * token and becomes something every single call has to carry. A screen that builds its own request and forgets the
 * header does not fail — it silently reads the angel's own records instead of the patient's, or the other way round,
 * and answers 200 either way. Being in one interceptor is what makes forgetting impossible rather than merely
 * discouraged.</p>
 *
 * <p>The corresponding rule: <strong>nothing else may set this header.</strong> A service that sets it directly is
 * the same defect wearing a different hat.</p>
 *
 * <h2>It is not a claim</h2>
 *
 * <p>The backend re-reads the delegation on every request, so this header selects among records the caller has
 * already been shown to be entitled to. Sending a patient id you hold no active delegation for is refused exactly as
 * if you had guessed a record id — which is also why it is safe for this to be a header a browser could tamper
 * with.</p>
