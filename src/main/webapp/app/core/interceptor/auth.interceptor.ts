/**
 * The endpoints whose whole job is to get you a token, or to work without one.
 *
 * Sending a token to these is not merely pointless — it locks people out. Spring Security's bearer
 * filter runs *before* authorization, so a token that is present and expired fails the request
 * outright and `permitAll` never gets a say. Sign-in then answers 401 for a reason that has nothing
 * to do with the credentials typed into it, and because the stored token is what caused the failure,
 * trying again does the same thing. The only way out was to clear site data by hand.
 *
 * It bites whenever a token expires while the tab is closed, which is the ordinary case: come back
 * the next morning, and the portal refuses the password it would have accepted an hour earlier.
 *
 * Matched against the gateway's own anonymous list in `SecurityConfiguration`; keep the two in step.
