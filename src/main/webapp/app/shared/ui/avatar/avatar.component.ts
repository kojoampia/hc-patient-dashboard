 *
 * The fallback is the point. The seeded record carries no photographs and a real one often will not
 * either, so the monogram is the normal case rather than the degraded one — which is why it is a
 * filled navy circle rather than a grey placeholder that reads as something failing to load.
 *
 * Decorative by default: the name it stands for is always rendered beside it, so announcing the
 * image as well would have a screen reader say the person twice.
