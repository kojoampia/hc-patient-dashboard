/**
 * Formatting the portal agreed on once, so a date does not read three different ways on three
 * screens. Everything here is pure — no injection, no locale service — because these are used
 * inside `computed()` bodies where an injection context is not guaranteed.
 *
 * ## Instants are the clinic's, not the reader's — calendar dates belong to nobody
 *
 * The record holds two different kinds of value and they need opposite treatment:
 *
 * - An **instant** — `visitedAt`, `openedAt`, `raisedAt`, `scheduledAt`, `loggedAt`, `recordedAt` —
 *   is a point in time. The care happened in Accra and the record was written in Accra time; a
 *   reader elsewhere is reading someone else's appointment, not scheduling their own, so shifting
 *   it to their clock states something the record does not say. Rendered locally from UTC+2, a
 *   23:05 alert became 01:05 the following morning — the wrong *day* on a clinical record. Use
 *   {@link formatDayTime}, {@link formatTime} or {@link formatInstantDay}.
 * - A **calendar date** — `birthDate`, `notedOn`, `startedOn`, `reportDate`, `createdDate`,
 *   `schedule` — is a `LocalDate` with no time and no zone. It must not be converted at all. The
 *   entity services parse these with `dayjs('1976-04-19')`, which lands on *local* midnight, so
 *   converting to UTC from any zone east of it moves the date back a day: a birthday of 19 April
 *   renders as the 18th. Use {@link formatDay}.
 *
 * Ghana keeps UTC all year with no daylight saving, so `.utc()` *is* Accra and no timezone database
 * is needed. The day a second locale appears this becomes a real zone lookup — which is why the
 * instant formatters go through {@link inZone} rather than calling `.format()` themselves.
 *
 * ## Strings are tolerated, and should not be
 *
 * The entity services convert their date fields to `dayjs` objects; anything fetched around them
 * arrives as an ISO string. Handing one to a formatter used to throw `e.format is not a function`
 * mid-render, which Angular reports as a blank panel rather than as an error anyone can act on —
 * `/record` and the profile's About tab were both empty for exactly this reason. Accepting a string
 * costs one coercion and turns that class of mistake into a correctly formatted date. Fix the
 * source anyway: the type still says `Dayjs` because that is what callers should pass.
