/**
 * The membership tiers a patient can choose from.

 * <h2>They belong to another product</h2>
 *
 * <p>Plans live in Abofonsa's content API, not in this subsystem. The gateway proxies them at {@code /api/plans} so
 * the browser stays same-origin: production builds with {@code SERVER_API_URL} empty, no CORS is configured anywhere
 * here, and production enforces a CSP — a direct call to another host would need all three changed to read a price
 * list.</p>
 *
 * <p>Prices arrive pre-formatted for the locale. That is deliberate on their side and worth respecting on this one:
 * the subsystem has a documented history of two products quoting different numbers for the same tier, and the way
 * that stays fixed is by never restating a price.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Unavailable is a normal state</h2>
 *
 * <p>Abofonsa is separately deployed and, at the time of writing, its production host is not yet serving. A patient
 * must not meet an error page because a second product is down — plan selection is the one part of onboarding that
 * was deliberately moved out of the journey for exactly this reason. An empty list means "not available", and the
 * screen says so quietly.</p>
