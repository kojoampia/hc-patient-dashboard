/**
 * Which host serves the privacy policy.
 *
 * <p>A spec for a constant looks like overreach until you know what it is guarding. This URL pointed at
 * `abofonsa.com/privacy` until 2026-08-31 — the launch-preview site, whose SPA fallback answers <b>200
 * with the countdown page</b> for every path. A patient who tapped "Read the privacy policy" on the
 * delete-my-record screen was shown a marketing countdown, on the one screen where they are deciding
 * whether to erase their medical history.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing could have failed.</b> The status was 200, the page rendered, the anchor was valid, and
 * no test in either client asks what a hardcoded external URL returns. It is the same shape as the
 * `routerLink` that opened a 404 and the `assetlinks.json` that answered `text/html` — this
 * subsystem's characteristic defect, which is always a wrong thing answering successfully.</p>
 *
 * <p>So this pins the decision rather than the string: change it deliberately, and when you do, check
 * the page's <i>content</i>. The status will be 200 either way.</p>
